# game-set
This is the small game SET which we were playing in paper chits, that is implemented in C programming.
We categorize this game into different players. The game required minimum of 1 player and maximum of 5 players. Actually 3 players are required to play this game in reality, but here if the user choose 1 or 2 players option the role other players will be played by computer. This game depends on luck, after getting the shuffled chits each player should keep on passing the chits untill a player got set (equal number of chits).
